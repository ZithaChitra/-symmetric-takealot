# A [takealot.com](https://takealot.com) clone. 

This project is meant for educational purposes (and fun, and headaches, and learning experiences that come with any software project)


## How to use it?

Clone the repo. Install it's dependencies.
Then go ahead and make modifications, break it apart (really !), then maybe create and/or
learn something new in the process.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZithaChitra/-symmetric-takealot.git

cd symmetric-takealot

npm install

npm run dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
